# My first cat image classifier
### From my solution to the week 1 assignment on Andrew ng's deep learning specialization
Logistic regression is used to distinguish between cats and non-cats.
## Testing
If you have Anaconda installed on your system, this classifier should work just fine.
All you need do is download any image of your choice, go to the bottom cat-image-classifier.py
and insert the name of the image file. Run the code and see it in action :sunglasses:
