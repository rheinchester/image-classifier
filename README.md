# My first cat image classifier
### From Andrew ng's neural network deep learning specialization
Linear regression is used to distinguish between cats and non-cats.
## Testing
As long as you have anaconda, installed on your system, this classifier should work well on you system
All you need do is download any image of your choice, go to the bottom cat-image-classifier.py
and insert the name of the image file. Run the code and see it in action :sunglasses:
