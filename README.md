# My first cat image classifier
###### From my solution to the week 1 assignment on Andrew ng's deep learning specialization
## Summary
The classifier distinguishes between cats and non-cats.
## Algorithm
Logistic regression
## Libraries
## Testing
If you have Anaconda installed on your system, this classifier should work just fine.
All you need do is download any image of your choice, go to the bottom cat-image-classifier.py
and insert the name of the image file. Run the code and see it in action :sunglasses:
