# My first cat image classifier
###### From my solution to the week 1 assignment on Andrew ng's deep learning specialization
## Summary
The classifier distinguishes between cats and non-cats.
## Algorithm
Gradient descent was used to reduce the cost function of the Logistic regression.
## Libraries
numpy - n-dimensional array computation.
matplotlib - matplotlib.pyplot was used to generate plots
h5py - used to process the hdf5 file
scipy- scipy.ndimage was used for multidimensional image processing
PIL -  for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file 

## Testing
If you have Anaconda installed on your system, this classifier should work just fine.
All you need do is download any image of your choice, go to the bottom cat-image-classifier.py
and insert the name of the image file. Run the code and see it in action :sunglasses:
